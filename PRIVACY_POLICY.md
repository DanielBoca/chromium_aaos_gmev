# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 19, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the `chromium_aaos_gmev` project ("we", "our", or "the Project") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the code, builds, or related services provided in this repository. It is written to align with common browser privacy practices and general principles used by Chromium-based projects while remaining specific to this repository.

If you are using a downstream product built from this repository, that product may have its own privacy policy and practices — consult the product's documentation or vendor for details.

1. Information We Collect

- Information you provide: When you contact maintainers, submit issues, or contribute code (e.g., via Git commits, comments, or pull requests), the information you provide — such as your name, email address, and any content you include — is stored in the repository history, issue tracker, and related services.
- Automatically collected technical data: Logs, build metadata, and other non-personal technical data may be recorded by CI systems and build tooling (for example: timestamps, build IDs, tool versions, and error traces). These are used to diagnose problems and improve automation.

2. How We Use Information

- To operate and maintain the repository and related build tooling.
- To triage, reproduce, and fix bugs reported in issues or crash reports.
- To manage contributions, reviews, and the code review process.
- To analyze build systems and performance of automation for maintenance and improvement.

3. Sharing and Disclosure

- Public repository content: Anything you post publicly in the repository (commits, issues, comments) is publicly accessible and may be indexed by search engines. Avoid including secrets or personal data in public contributions.
- Third-party services: We may use third-party services (e.g., Git hosting, CI providers, code analysis services) to host and process repository content and build artifacts. Those providers process data under their own terms and privacy policies.
- Legal requirements: We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations, enforce policies, or protect rights, safety, or property.

4. Cookies and Local Storage (for associated web services)

If this project publishes web-based dashboards or services, those services may use cookies or local storage managed by the hosting provider. Such cookies are used for authentication, session management, and analytics. Consult the specific service's privacy or cookie settings for details.

5. Data Retention

We retain repository data (commits, issues, pull requests) as long as it exists in the repository or hosting service. Build logs and CI artifacts may be retained according to the retention settings of the CI provider. If you need removal of personal data from repository history, contact the maintainers; note that removing data from git history can be disruptive and may not remove all copies (e.g., forks, mirrors, backups).

6. Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect repository infrastructure and build systems. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security — do not store secrets, credentials, or sensitive personal data in the repository or in public issue trackers.

7. Contributor Guidance

- Do not include personal data, passwords, API keys, certificates, or other secrets in commits or issues.
- Follow the project's CONTRIBUTING guidelines for how to submit code, tests, and issues.
- When in doubt about including someone else's personal data in a report or patch, redact or anonymize before submitting.

8. Your Rights and Controls

- Access: You can view data you have posted in the repository at any time by viewing the relevant commits, issues, or pull requests.
- Correction/Removal: If you need personal data corrected or removed from repository-maintained copies, contact maintainers. Removal requests may be limited by technical constraints (e.g., distributed forks and caches).

9. International Transfers

Repository hosting, CI, and third-party services may process data outside your jurisdiction. Such transfers are governed by the third-party providers' policies.

10. Children

This repository and its services are not directed at children under 13. Do not submit personal data about children.

11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this file. Significant changes will be noted in the repository changelog or release notes when feasible.

12. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or requests concerning your data, open an issue or contact the repository maintainers through the project's preferred contact channel.

13. Additional Legal Notices

This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes for contributors and users of this repository. It does not replace any privacy notices provided by downstream products or hosting providers. For full legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), downstream product owners should adopt a tailored policy covering their data practices and legal bases for processing.

Recommended next steps for downstream authors:
- Review this draft and adapt wording to your product and hosting environment.
- Add links to your hosting provider's privacy policy and any analytics services you enable.
- Provide a clear process for requests to remove or rectify personal data recorded in repository history.
